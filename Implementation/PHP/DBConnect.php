*   This is a short PHP file that will handle database connections and
*   pull all of the necessary database information from the .env
*   file. Use the following instructions to setup the .env file:
*
*   1) Ensure your current directory is the directory including
*      .env.example and perform the command `cp .env.example .env`
*   2) Open the new .env file and fill in the appropriate information
*       NOTE: If the database either does not exist or no database is
*             specified in .env, a connection will be made without a
*             specific database
